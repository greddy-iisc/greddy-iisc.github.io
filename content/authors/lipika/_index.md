Using the tools of statistical thermodynamics and molecular dynamics simulations, I am working on the physicochemical properties of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) in the presence of various cosolvents, such as denaturants, protective osmolytes, and salts. I am also interested in studying the properties of biomolecular condensates enriched with IDPs and the role of external factors such as temperature, pH, salts, and cosolvents in modulating the stability of these condensates. 

I love cooking and spending time with family and friends in my spare time.
