I joined IISc as an Integrated-PhD candidate in 2013 after completing BSc in Chemistry-major from the University of Burdwan, West Bengal. As a part of my MS thesis, I utilized machine learning to predict nucleosome positioning on DNA. During my Ph.D. tenure, I developed coarse-grained codes for polymer bundles and RNA. For my Ph.D. thesis, I primarily focus on how intracellular cations guide riboswitches to attain specific conformation and regulate downstream genes. Now, I want to utilize my skills and experience to study the cotranscriptional folding of riboswitches. I am well-versed in biomolecular modeling using both atomistic and coarse-grained models. I use statistical mechanics, MD simulations, Markov state models, machine learning (ANN and SVM), and bioinformatics to study RNA-related phenomena.
