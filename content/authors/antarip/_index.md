I am a computational bio-physicist, presently pursuing a post doctoral research on understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA folding process. For that I am using different molecular dynamics based approaches. In my doctoral thesis I have studied the consequences of different nucleobase modifications in RNA using quantum mechanics based theories combined with Bioinformatics approaches. 
My future goal is to pursue a research career in the interdisciplinary domain combining different disciplines of computational natural sciences.
