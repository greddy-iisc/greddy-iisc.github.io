Graduate and undergraduate students (chemistry and physics), who enjoy theoretical modeling or computer programming and are interested in solving problems at the interface of chemistry, physics, and biology using statistical mechanics, please get in touch. 

We use analytical methods, develop simulation codes for models of different resolutions to probe multiple length and time scales, and utilize machine learning tools to obtain insights into the problems.   

Write to me (<a href="mailto:greddy@iisc.ac.in">{{< icon name="envelope" pack="fas" >}}</a>) or meet me in my office in the chemical sciences building (room# B201).
