Our research interests are in the area of theoretical/computational biophysics and polymer physics.<!--more--> Proteins synthesized in the cell generally fold into specific 3-dimensional structures to perform their functions. Due to undue stresses on the cell, misfolding and aggregation of proteins can occur, which lead to several pathological diseases. Our research is geared towards understanding the basic principles involved in protein folding/aggregation, DNA-protein interactions, and DNA condensation. Depending on the system of interest, we use and develop atomistic, coarse-grained and continuum-based protein-DNA models and appropriate theoretical/computational techniques to gain insight into the relevant physics of the phenomenon.
