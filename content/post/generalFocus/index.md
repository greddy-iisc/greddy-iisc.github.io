Our research interests are in the area of theoretical/computational biophysics and biophysical chemistry.<!--more--> Depending on the system of interest, we use and develop atomistic, coarse-grained and continuum-based protein-DNA models and appropriate theoretical/computational techniques to gain insight into the relevant physics of the phenomenon.
