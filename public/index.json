An unfolded protein under favorable conditions navigates its complex energy landscape on a time scale of milliseconds to seconds and folds into a specific three dimensional structure. The mechanism of protein folding is affected by multiple factors such as temperature, pressure, pH and co-solvents. In this thesis using coarse-grained protein models and molecular dynamics simulations, I have studied various aspects of cosolvent induced protein folding. I have specifically addressed problems related to the early stages of protein folding, transient intermediates populated in the folding pathway and salt effects on protein folding thermodynamics. Proteins, which are finite sized heteropolymers are believed to undergo a coil-globule transition similar to polymers during the early stages of folding. However, single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments studying coil-globule transition arrived at qualitatively different conclusions. Using computer simulations we have found that finite size proteins do exhibit small compaction on dilution of denaturant concentration. The FRET experiments overestimated the compaction due to approximating the protein as a Gaussian polymer chain, whereas the small compaction observed is within the statistical uncertainty of the SAXS experiments leading to the controversy. The protein compaction during the early stages of folding can be either specific or non-specific. The specific compaction in protein is due to the formation of a few native-like long ranged contacts in the protein during the early stages of folding. SAXS experiments on the protein monellin predicted that the compaction in this protein is specific. Using simulations, we have shown that the formation of a few native-like contacts in the β-strands of the proteins can lead to ∼ 17% compaction in the protein dimensions. We have also developed a computational model to predict the salt effects on the folding thermodynamics of proteins. Using lac-DBD and NTL9 as model systems we studied the effect of 7 different salts on their folding thermodynamics. I made several predictions, which can be verified by experiments on salt effects on the protein size in the denatured ensemble, and the subtle structural changes in the protein transition state ensemble, which are in line with the Hammond’s postulate. Recent FRET experiments on small globular proteins widely believed to be two-state folders have shown evidence for the population of transiently populated protein intermediate states. Using simulations, we studied the folding of protein L, and resolved the structure of a transient intermediate populated in its folding pathway ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0aff0040fda52a32138f5baa10626ccc","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/author/dr.-hiranmay-maity/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr.-hiranmay-maity/","section":"authors","summary":"Thesis Title: Co-solvent Induced Protein Collapse and Folding.

The solution pH is one of the critical factors that can influence ligand binding to a protein cavity, especially in enzymes whose function is sensitive to the pH. Using computer simulations, we studied the pH effect on the binding of a guanidinium ion (Gdm+) to the active site of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). HEWL serves as a model system for enzymes with two acidic residues in the active site and ligands with Gdm+ moieties, which can bind to the active sites of such enzymes and are present in several approved drugs treating various disorders. The computed free energy surface (FES) shows that Gdm+ binds to the HEWL active site using two dominant binding pathways populating multiple intermediates. We show that the residues close to the active site that can anchor the ligand could play a critical role in ligand binding. Using a Markov state model, we quantified the lifetimes and kinetic pathways connecting the different states in the FES. The protonation and deprotonation of the acidic residues in the active site in response to the pH change strongly influence the Gdm+ binding. There is a sharp jump in the ligand-binding rate constant when the pH approaches the largest pKa of the acidic residue present in the active site. The simulations reveal that, at most, three Gdm+ can bind at the active site, with the Gdm+ bound in the cavity of the active site acting as a scaffold for the other two Gdm+ ions binding. These results can aid in providing greater insights into designing novel molecules containing Gdm+ moieties that can have high binding affinities to inhibit the function of enzymes with acidic residues in their active site.","tags":[""],"title":"pH Regulates Ligand Binding to an Enzyme Active Site by Modulating Intermediate Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lipika Baidya","Govardhan Reddy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665100800,"objectID":"69831b6a26efa978871dbb32f4624b2d","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/publication/paper51/","publishdate":"2022-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper51/","section":"publication","summary":"Aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases.

We show that compaction in the proTα dimension at low pH is due to the protein’s collapse in the intermediate region (E41–D80) rich in glutamic acid residues, enhancing its β-sheet content. We observed by performing dimer simulations that the conformations with high β-sheet content could act as aggregation-prone (N*) states and nucleate the aggregation process.

In low ionic strength solutions, IDP conformations are perturbed by the screening of electrostatic interactions, independent of the salt identity. In this regime, insight into the IDP behavior can be obtained using the theory for salt-induced transitions in charged polymers. However, salt-specific interactions with the charged and uncharged residues, known as the Hofmeister effect, influence IDP behavior in high ionic strength solutions. There is a lack of reliable theoretical models in high salt concentration regimes to predict the salt effect on IDPs. We propose a simulation methodology using a coarse-grained IDP model and experimentally measured water to salt solution transfer free energies of various chemical groups that allowed us to study the salt-specific transitions induced in the IDPs conformational ensemble. We probed the effect of three different monovalent salts on five IDPs belonging to various polymer classes based on charged residue content. We demonstrate that all of the IDPs of different polymer classes behave as self-avoiding walks (SAWs) at physiological salt concentration. In high salt concentrations, the transitions observed in the IDP conformational ensembles are dependent on the salt used and the IDP sequence and composition. Changing the anion with the cation fixed can result in the IDP transition from a SAW-like behavior to a collapsed globule. An important implication of these results is that a suitable salt can be identified to induce condensation of an IDP through LLPS.","tags":[""],"title":"Salt-Induced Transitions in the Conformational Ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antarip Halder","Sunil Kumar","Sk Habibullah","Govardhan Reddy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660608000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660608000,"objectID":"731d984f834ce6c6485b7e3f06b7ff13","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/publication/paper48/","publishdate":"2022-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper48/","section":"publication","summary":"RNA folding and functioning require the binding of metal ions in specific cavities of the folded structure.

The fluoride riboswitch is essential for bacteria’s survival as it is critical to maintaining the F− ion concentration below the toxic level. The anionic cognate ligand, F− ion, is encapsulated by three Mg2+ ions in a trigonal pyramidal arrangement bound to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the riboswitch. The assembly mechanism of this intriguing LBD structure and its role in transcription initiation are not clear. Computer simulations using both coarse-grained and all-atom RNA models show that F− and Mg2+ binding to the LBD are essential to stabilize the LBD structure and tertiary stacking interactions. We propose that the first two Mg2+ ions sequentially bind to the LBD through water-mediated outer-shell coordination. The first bound Mg2+ should undergo a transition to a direct inner shell interaction through dehydration to strengthen its interaction with LBD before the binding of the second Mg2+ ion. The binding of the third Mg2+ and F− to the LBD occurs in two modes. In the first mode, the third Mg2+ binds first to the LBD, followed by F− binding. In the second mode, Mg2+ and F− form a water-mediated ion pair and bind to the LBD simultaneously, which we propose to be the efficient binding mode. We show that the linchpin hydrogen bonds involved in the antiterminator helix formation and transcription initiation are stable only after F− binding.

We ask the question under thermodynamic conditions, can the riboswitches populate structures similar to the holo-form only in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of cognate ligand binding. We addressed this question using thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch as a model system and computer simulations using a coarse-grained model for RNA. The folding free energy surface (FES) shows that with the initial increase in Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]), the aptamer domain (AD) of TPP riboswitch undergoes a barrierless collapse in its dimensions. On further increase in [Mg2+], intermediates separated by barriers appear on the FES, and one of the intermediates has a TPP ligand-binding competent structure. We show that site-specific binding of the Mg2+ aids in the formation of tertiary contacts. For [Mg2+] greater than physiological concentration, AD folds into a structure similar to the crystal structure of the TPP holo-form even in the absence of the TPP ligand. The folding kinetics shows that TPP AD populates an intermediate due to the misalignment of two arms present in the structure, which acts as a kinetic trap, leading to larger folding timescales. The predictions of the intermediate structures from the simulations are amenable for experimental verification.","tags":[""],"title":"TPP Riboswitch Populates Holo-Form-like Structure Even in the Absence of Cognate Ligand at High Mg2+ Concentration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Balaka Mondal","D.

By fitting the data to one-dimensional analytical models of the energy landscape, we can extract the hopping rates between the folded and unfolded states in two-state folders as well as the height and the location of the transition state (TS). Although this approach is remarkably insightful, there are cases for which the energy landscape is multidimensional (catch bonds being the most prominent). To assess if the unfolding energy landscape in small single domain proteins could be one-dimensional, we simulated force-induced unfolding of ubiquitin (Ub) using the coarse-grained self-organized polymer–side chain (SOP-SC) model. Brownian dynamics simulations using the SOP-SC model reveal that the Ub energy landscape is weakly multidimensional (WMD), governed predominantly by a single barrier. The unfolding pathway is confined to a narrow reaction pathway that could be described as diffusion in a quasi-1D X-dependent free energy profile. However, a granular analysis using the Pfold analysis, which does not assume any form for the reaction coordinate, shows that X alone does not account for the height and, more importantly, the location of the TS. The f-dependent TS location moves toward the folded state as f increases, in accord with the Hammond postulate. Our study shows that, in addition to analyzing the f-dependent hopping rates, the transition state ensemble must also be determined without resorting to X as a reaction coordinate to describe the unfolding energy landscapes of single domain proteins, especially if they are only WMD.","tags":[""],"title":"Energy Landscape of Ubiquitin is Weakly Multidimensional","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Govardhan Reddy","D Thirumalai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"033c3cc103134b237f9135d4f829ccff","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/publication/paper45/","publishdate":"2021-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper45/","section":"publication","summary":"Single molecule pulling experiments have shown that DNA in the nucleosomes unwraps in two stages from the histone protein core (HPC).

The inner DNA turn ruptures irreversibly at forces between 9 and 15 pNs (or higher) in the second stage. Molecular simulations using the Self-Organized Polymer model capture the experimental findings. The unwrapping of the outer DNA turn is independent of the pulling direction. The rupture of the DNA inner turn depends on the pulling direction and involves overcoming substantial energetic (most likely electrostatic in origin) and kinetic barriers. They arise because the mechanical force has to generate sufficient torque to rotate the HPC by 180°. On the other hand, during the rewrapping process, HPC rotation is stochastic, with force playing no role. The assembly of the outer DNA wrap upon force quench nearly coincides with the unwrapping process, confirming the reversibility of the outer turn rupture. The asymmetry in HPC rotation during unwrapping and rewrapping explains the observed hysteresis in the stretch-release cycles in experiments.

Structural perturbations in the protein often trigger aggregation, which eventually leads to cataract. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanism, it is important to characterize the partially unfolded conformations, which are aggregation-prone. Using a coarse grained protein model and molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the role of on-pathway folding intermediates in the early stages of aggregation. The multidimensional free energy surface revealed at least three different folding pathways with the population of partially structured intermediates. The two dominant pathways confirm sequential folding of the N-terminal [Ntd] and the C-terminal domains [Ctd], while the third, least favored, pathway involves intermediates where both the domains are partially folded. A native-like intermediate (I*), featuring the folded domains and disrupted interdomain contacts, gets populated in all three pathways. I* forms domain swapped dimers by swapping the entire Ntds and Ctds with other monomers. Population of such oligomers can explain the increased resistance to unfolding resulting in hysteresis observed in the folding experiments of HγD Crys. An ensemble of double domain swapped dimers are also formed during refolding, where intermediates consisting of partially folded Ntds and Ctds swap secondary structures with other monomers. The double domain swapping model presented in our study provides structural insights into the early events of aggregation in Crys proteins and identifies the key secondary structural swapping elements, where introducing mutations will aid in regulating the overall aggregation propensity.","tags":[""],"title":"Double Domain Swapping in Human γC and γD Crystallin Drives Early Stages of Aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antarip Halder","Sunil Kumar","Omar Valsson","Govardhan Reddy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600300800,"objectID":"0e6897a2ff4cd813da4a7f032c3c923f","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/publication/paper43/","publishdate":"2020-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper43/","section":"publication","summary":"RNA molecules selectively bind to specific metal ions to populate their functional active states, making it important to understand their source of ion selectivity. In large RNA systems, metal ions interact with the RNA at multiple locations, making it difficult to decipher the precise role of ions in folding. To overcome this complexity, we studied the role of different metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+) in the folding of a small RNA hairpin motif (5′-ucCAAAga-3′) using unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The advantage of studying this system is that it requires specific binding of a single metal ion to fold to its native state. We find that even for this small RNA, the folding free energy surface (FES) is multidimensional as different metal ions present in the solution can simultaneously facilitate folding. The FES shows that specific binding of a metal ion is indispensable for its folding. We further show that in addition to the negatively charged phosphate groups, the spatial organization of electronegative nucleobase atoms drives the site-specific binding of the metal ions. Even though the binding site cannot discriminate between different metal ions, RNA folds efficiently only in a Mg2+ solution. We show that the rigid network of Mg2+-coordinated water molecules facilitates the formation of important interactions in the transition state. The other metal ions such as K+ and Ca2+ cannot facilitate the formation of such interactions. These results allow us to hypothesize possible metal-sensing mechanisms in large metalloriboswitches and also provide useful insights into the design of appropriate collective variables for studying large RNA molecules using enhanced sampling methods.","tags":[""],"title":"Mg2+ Sensing by an RNA Fragment: Role of Mg2+-Coordinated Water Molecules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Lysozyme has four disulfide bonds and is widely studied for its antibacterial properties. Experiments on lysozyme infer that the protein folds through a fast and a slow pathway. However, the reasons for the kinetic partitioning in the folding pathways are not completely clear. Using a coarse-grained protein model and simulations, we show that two out of the four disulfide bonds, which are present in the α-domain of lysozyme, are responsible for the slow folding pathway. In this pathway, a kinetically trapped intermediate state, which is close to the native state, is populated. In this state, the orientations of α-helices present in the α-domain are misaligned relative to each other. The protein in this state has to partially unfold by breaking down the interhelical contacts between the misaligned helices to fold to the native state. However, the topological constraints due to the two disulfide bonds present in the α-domain make the protein less flexible, and it is trapped in this conformation for hundreds of milliseconds. On disabling these disulfide bonds, we find that the kinetically trapped intermediate state and the slow folding pathway disappear. Simulations mimicking the folding of protein without disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions show that the native disulfide bonds are formed as the protein folds, indicating that folding guides the formation of disulfide bonds. The sequence of formation of the disulfide bonds is Cys64–Cys80 → Cys76–Cys94 → Cys30–Cys115 → Cys6–Cys127. Any disulfide bond that forms before its precursor in the sequence has to break and follow the sequence for the protein to fold. These results show that lysozyme also serves as a very good model system to probe the role of disulfide bonds and topological frustration in protein folding.

DNA molecules condense into toroids and spindles upon the addition of multivalent ions. Nucleation of a loop in the semiflexible DNA chain is critical for both the toroid and spindle formation. To understand the structural differences in the nucleated loop, which cause bifurcation in the condensation pathways leading to toroid or spindle formation, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained bead–spring polymer model. We find that the formation of a toroid or a spindle is correlated with the orientation of the chain segments close to the loop closure in the nucleated loop. Simulations show that toroids grow in size when spindles in solution interact with a pre-existing toroid and merge into it by spooling around the circumference of the toroid, forming multimolecular toroidal condensates. The merging of spindles with toroids is facile, indicating that this should be the dominant pathway through which the toroids grow in size. The Steinhardt bond order parameter analysis of the toroid cross section shows that the chains pack in a hexagonal fashion. In agreement with the experiments there are regions in the toroid with good hexagonal packing and also with considerable disorder. The disorder in packing is due to the defects, which are propagated during the growth of toroids. In addition to the well-known crossover defect, we have identified three other forms of defects, which perturb hexagonal packing. The new defects identified in the simulations are amenable to experimental verification.","tags":[""],"title":"Toroidal Condensates by Semiflexible Polymer Chains: Insights into Nucleation, Growth and Packing Defects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shyamashis Das","Atreya Dey","Govardhan Reddy","D.

A number of experiments on Ub folding have reached differing conclusions regarding the relation between collapse and folding, and whether intermediates are populated. In order to resolve these vexing issues, we elucidate the denaturant-dependent thermodynamics and kinetics of Ub folding at low and neutral pH as a function of guanidinium chloride and urea using coarse-grained molecular simulations. The changes in the fraction of the folded Ub, and the radius of gyration (Rg) as a function of the denaturant concentration, [C], are in quantitative agreement with experiments. Under conditions used in experiments, Rg of the unfolded state at neutral pH changes only by ≈17% as the [GdmCl] decreases from 6 to 0 M. We predict that the extent of compaction of the unfolded state increases as temperature decreases. A two-dimensional folding landscape as a function of Rg and a measure of similarity to the folded state reveals unambiguously that the native state assembly is preceded by collapse, as discovered in fast mixing experiments on several proteins. Analyses of the folding trajectories, under mildly denaturing conditions ([GdmCl] = 1.0 M or [Urea] = 1.0 M), shows that Ub folds by collision between preformed secondary structural elements involving kinetic intermediates that are primarily stabilized by long-range contacts. Our work explains the results of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on Ub quantitatively, and establishes that evolved globular proteins in the unfolded ensemble are poised to collapse as the solvent conditions for the biopolymer changes from good solvent to Θ-solvent like conditions on denaturant dilution. In the process, we explain the discrepancy between SAXS and single molecule fluorescent resonant energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, which have arrived at a contradicting conclusion concerning the collapse of polypeptide chains.","tags":[""],"title":"Collapse Precedes Folding in Denaturant-Dependent Assembly of Ubiquitin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aswathy N.

The free-energy surface for the growth of the protofibril shows three major basins, corresponding to the free state where the peptide is in solution, the docked state where the peptide in solution interacts with the surface of the protofibril, and the locked state where the peptide is tightly bound to the protofibril, becoming a part of the fibril. The free-energy surface in the presence of TMAO shows that TMAO stabilizes the locked state of the peptide compared with the free state, indicating that TMAO aids in fibril growth. Dissecting the interaction of TMAO with individual amino acids in the peptide shows that TMAO interacts both directly and indirectly with the amino acids, depending on the nature of the side chains. The methyl groups in TMAO interact strongly with the hydrophobic aromatic ring in the Tyr residue. In the locked state, the surface area of Tyr available for interaction with TMAO decreases; as a result, the Tyr residue in the peptide flips out from the locked position, increasing the fluctuations of the peptide locked in the protofibril. Such strong direct interactions of amino acids with TMAO destabilize the folded or aggregated states of proteins. The overall increased stability of the peptide locked in the protofibril by TMAO is due to entropic or indirect interactions with the backbone Asn and Gln residues, which form major components of the NNQQNY peptide.","tags":[""],"title":"Osmolyte Effects on the Growth of Amyloid Fibrils","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiranmay Maity","Govardhan Reddy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"71e3124e5e15916723fa8215bcf64449","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/publication/paper24/","publishdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper24/","section":"publication","summary":"A fundamental question in protein folding is whether the coil to globule collapse transition occurs during the initial stages of folding (burst phase) or simultaneously with the protein folding transition.

We study Protein L folding using a coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations. The collapse transition in Protein L is found to be concomitant with the folding transition. In the burst phase of folding, we find that FRET experiments overestimate radius of gyration, Rg, of the protein due to the application of Gaussian polymer chain end-to-end distribution to extract Rg from the FRET efficiency. FRET experiments estimate ≈6 Å decrease in Rg when the actual decrease is ≈3 Å on guanidinium chloride denaturant dilution from 7.5 to 1 M, thereby suggesting pronounced compaction in the protein dimensions in the burst phase. The ≈3 Å decrease is close to the statistical uncertainties of the Rg data measured from SAXS experiments, which suggest no compaction, leading to a disagreement with the FRET experiments.

We use the molecular transfer model (MTM), currently the only method that accomplishes this goal, albeit phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of the PDZ2 domain, a protein that is important in molecular recognition and signaling. Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit a downward curvature at high urea concentrations ([C]’s), which has been interpreted as indicating the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate. Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained self-organized polymer (SOP) representation of PDZ2 are used to show that the intermediate (IEQ), which has some native-like character, is present in equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap order parameter show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states. Structures of the transition state ensembles (TSE1 separating the unfolded and IEQ and TSE2 separating IEQ and the native state), determined using the Pfold method, show that TSE1 is greatly expanded while TSE2 is compact and native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In one pathway, folding occurs exclusively through I1, which resembles IEQ. In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs through a combination of I1 and a kinetic intermediate. We establish that the radius of gyration (RgU) of the unfolded state is more compact (by ∼9%) under native conditions. Theory and simulations show that the decrease in RgU occurs on the time scale on the order of at most ∼20 μs. The modest decrease in RgU and the rapid collapse suggest that high spatial and temporal resolution, currently beyond the scope of most small-angle X-ray scattering experiments, are needed to detect compaction in finite-sized proteins. The present work further establishes that MTM is efficacious in producing nearly quantitative predictions for folding of proteins under conditions used in experiments.","tags":[""],"title":"Folding PDZ2 Domain Using the Molecular Transfer Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Govardhan Reddy","D.

The melting temperatures (Tm’s), identified with the peaks in the heat capacity curves, decrease as pH decreases, in qualitative agreement with experiments. The calculated radius of gyration, showing dramatic variations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At Tm, Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis of the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at Tm, with multiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, shows a network of metastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral pH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations resulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal that Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination of nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by which Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural elements responsible for establishing long-range contacts and collapse of Ub. Nucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are marginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes associated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of microseconds, then Ub folding follows the diffusion–collision mechanism with intermediates, many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium. Folding at neutral pH is a sequential process with a populated intermediate resembling that sampled at equilibrium. The transition state structures, obtained using a Pfold analysis, are homogeneous and globular with most of the secondary and tertiary structures being native-like. Many of our findings for both the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding are not only in agreement with experiments but also provide missing details not resolvable in standard experiments. The key prediction that folding mechanism varies dramatically with pH is amenable to experimental tests.","tags":[""],"title":"Dissecting Ubiquitin Folding Using the Self-Organized Polymer Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

The MTM in conjunction with the coarse-grained self organized polymer model with side chains (SOP-SC) for polypeptide chains is used to simulate the folding of the src-SH3 domain as a function of temperature (T) and guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration [C]. Besides reproducing the thermodynamic aspects of SH3 folding, the SOP-SC also captures the cooperativity of the folding transitions. A number of experimentally testable predictions are also made. First, we predict that the melting temperature Tm([C]) decreases linearly as [C] increases. Second, we show that the midpoints Cm,i and melting temperatures Tm,i at which individual residues acquire 50% of their native contacts differ from the global midpoint (Cm ≈ 2.5 M) and melting temperature (Tm = 355 K) at which the folded and unfolded states coexist. Dispersion in Cm,i is greater than that found for Tm,i. Third, folding kinetics at [C] = 0 M shows that the acquisition of contacts between all the secondary structural elements and global folding occur nearly simultaneously. Finally, from the free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap function and the radius of gyration of the protein, we find that at a fixed T the transition state moves toward the folded state as [C] increases in accord with the Hammond postulate.

To understand the mechanism of TMAO induced stabilization of folded protein states, we systematically investigated the action of TMAO on several model dipeptides (leucine, L2, serine, S2, glutamine, Q2, lysine, K2, and glycine, G2) in order to elucidate the effect of residue-specific TMAO interactions on small fragments of solvent-exposed conformations of the denatured states of proteins. We find that TMAO preferentially hydrogen bonds with the exposed dipeptide backbone but generally not with nonpolar or polar side chains. However, interactions with the positively charged Lys are substantially greater than with the backbone. The dipeptide G2 is a useful model of the pure amide backbone; interacts with TMAO by forming a hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen and the oxygen in TMAO. In contrast, TMAO is depleted from the protein backbone in the hexapeptide G6, which shows that the length of the polypeptide chain is relevant in aqueous TMAO solutions. These simulations lead to the hypothesis that TMAO-induced stabilization of proteins and peptides is a consequence of depletion of the solute from the protein surface provided intramolecular interactions are more favorable than those between TMAO and the backbone. To test our hypothesis, we performed additional simulations of the action of TMAO on an intrinsically disordered Aβ16–22 (KLVFFAE) monomer. In the absence of TMAO, Aβ16–22 is a disordered random coil. However, in aqueous TMAO solution, Aβ16–22 monomer samples compact conformations. A transition from random coil to α-helical secondary structure is observed at high TMAO concentrations. The coil to α-helix transition is highly cooperative especially considering the small number of residues in Aβ16–22. Our work highlights the potential similarities between the action of TMAO on long polypeptide chains and entropic stabilization of proteins in a crowded environment due to excluded volume interactions. In this sense, the chemical chaperone TMAO is a nanocrowding particle.","tags":[""],"title":"Entropic Stabilization of Proteins by TMAO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Our incomplete understanding of this process underscores the need to decipher the principles governing protein aggregation. Mechanisms of in vivo amyloid formation involve a number of coconspirators and complex interactions with membranes. Nevertheless, understanding the biophysical basis of simpler in vitro amyloid formation is considered important for discovering ligands that preferentially bind regions harboring amyloidogenic tendencies. The determination of the fibril structure of many peptides has set the stage for probing the dynamics of oligomer formation and amyloid growth through computer simulations. Most experimental and simulation studies, however, have been interpreted largely from the perspective of proteins **:** the role of solvent has been relatively overlooked in oligomer formation and assembly to protofilaments and amyloid fibrils. In this Account, we provide a perspective on how interactions with water affect folding landscapes of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers, oligomer formation in the Aβ16–22 fragment, and protofilament formation in a peptide from yeast prion Sup35. Explicit molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how water controls the self-assembly of higher order structures, providing a structural basis for understanding the kinetics of oligomer and fibril growth. Simulations show that monomers of Aβ peptides sample a number of compact conformations. The formation of aggregation-prone structures (N*) with a salt bridge, strikingly similar to the structure in the fibril, requires overcoming a high desolvation barrier. In general, sequences for which N* structures are not significantly populated are unlikely to aggregate.\nOligomers and fibrils generally form in two steps. First, water is expelled from the region between peptides rich in hydrophobic residues (for example, Aβ16–22), resulting in disordered oligomers. Then the peptides align along a preferred axis to form ordered structures with anti-parallel β-strand arrangement. The rate-limiting step in the ordered assembly is the rearrangement of the peptides within a confining volume.\nThe mechanism of protofilament formation in a polar peptide fragment from the yeast prion, in which the two sheets are packed against each other and create a dry interface, illustrates that water dramatically slows self-assembly. As the sheets approach each other, two perfectly ordered one-dimensional water wires form. They are stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the amide groups of the polar side chains, resulting in the formation of long-lived metastable structures. Release of trapped water from the pore creates a helically twisted protofilament with a dry interface. Similarly, the driving force for addition of a solvated monomer to a preformed fibril is water release; the entropy gain and favorable interpeptide hydrogen bond formation compensate for entropy loss in the peptides.\nWe conclude by offering evidence that a two-step model, similar to that postulated for protein crystallization, must also hold for higher order amyloid structure formation starting from N*. Distinct water-laden polymorphic structures result from multiple N* structures. Water plays multifarious roles in all of these protein aggregations. In predominantly hydrophobic sequences, water accelerates fibril formation. In contrast, water-stabilized metastable intermediates dramatically slow fibril growth rates in hydrophilic sequences.","tags":[""],"title":"Role of Water in Protein Aggregation and Amyloid Polymorphism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenxing Liu","Govardhan Reddy","Edward P.

Stability of the native state decreases linearly as [C] (the concentration of guanidinium chloride) increases with the slope, m, that is in excellent agreement with experiments. Remarkably, the calculated folding rate at [C] = 0 is only 16-fold larger than the measured value. Most importantly ln kobs (kobs is the sum of folding and unfolding rates) as a function of [C] has the characteristic V (chevron) shape. In every folding trajectory, the times for reaching the native state, interactions stabilizing all the substructures, and global collapse coincide. The value of  (mf is the slope of the folding arm of the chevron plot) is identical to the fraction of buried solvent accessible surface area in the structures of the transition state ensemble. In the dominant transition state, which does not vary significantly at low [C], the core of the protein and certain loops are structured.

Formation of such a dry interface is usually associated with self-assembly of extended hydrophobic surfaces. Here we investigate how a dry interface is created in the process of protofilament formation in vastly different sequences using two amyloidogenic peptides, one a polar sequence from the N terminus of the yeast prion Sup35 and the other a predominantly hydrophobic sequence from the C terminus of Aβ-peptide. Using molecular dynamics simulations with three force fields we show that spontaneous formation of two ordered one-dimensional water wires in the pore between the two sheets of the Sup35 protofilaments results in long-lived structures, which are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules in the wires and the polar side chains in the β-sheet. Upon decreasing the stability of the metastable structures, water molecules are expelled resulting in a helically twisted protofilament in which side chains from a pair of β-strands in each sheet pack perfectly resulting in a dry interface. Although drying in hydrophobically dominated interfaces is abrupt, resembling a liquid to vapor transition, we find that discrete transitions between the liquid to one-dimensional ordered water in the nanopore enclosed by the two β-sheets to dry interface formation characterizes protofilament assembly in the yeast prions. Indeed, as the two sheets of the hydrophobic Aβ-sequence approach each other, fibril formation and expulsion of water molecules occur rapidly and nearly simultaneously.","tags":[""],"title":"Dry Amyloid Fibril Assembly in a Yeast Prion Peptide is Mediated by Long-Lived Structures Containing Water Wires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mai Suan Li","Nguyen Truong Co","Govardhan Reddy","Chin-Kun Hu","J.

Molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations are reported for the explicit and implicit solvent models, respectively. All three models give similar results for the adsorption of the chains in good solvent. The electrostatic attraction between the surface and the polymers is not sufficient to drive the strong adsorption that is seen in experiments. In poor solvents, the models give different results for the adsorption excess and the mechanism for polyelectrolyte adsorption. With explicit solvent, thick adsorbed layers are formed at both charged and neutral surfaces. With the SASA model, adsorbed layers are formed on the charged but not on the neutral surface. With the ILJ model, adsorbed layers are not formed on any surfaces. The results show that the solvent plays a dominant role in the adsorption of polyelectrolytes under poor solvent conditions and that many-body solvent effects have a qualitative effect on the adsorption characteristics and mechanism. In particular, SASA and depletion effects could possibly play an important role; the former can be incorporated in the SASA model, but the latter cannot.

We have carried out extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to monitor the structural changes that occur upon addition of random coil (RC) monomer fragments from the yeast prion Sup35 and Aβ-peptide onto a preformed fibril. Using the atomic resolution structures of the microcrystals as the starting points, we show that the RC → β-strand transition for the Sup35 fragment occurs abruptly over a very narrow time interval, whereas the acquisition of strand content is less dramatic for the hydrophobic-rich Aβ-peptide. Expulsion of water, resulting in the formation of a dry interface between 2 adjacent sheets of the Sup35 fibril, occurs in 2 stages. Ejection of a small number of discrete water molecules in the second stage follows a rapid decrease in the number of water molecules in the first stage. Stability of the Sup35 fibril is increased by a network of hydrogen bonds involving both backbone and side chains, whereas the marginal stability of the Aβ-fibrils is largely due to the formation of weak dispersion interaction between the hydrophobic side chains. The importance of the network of hydrogen bonds is further illustrated by mutational studies, which show that substitution of the Asn and Gln residues to Ala compromises the Sup35 fibril stability. Despite the similarity in the architecture of the amyloid fibrils, the growth mechanism and stability of the fibrils depend dramatically on the sequence.","tags":[""],"title":"Dynamics of Locking of Peptides onto Growing Amyloid Fibrils","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Confinement strongly alters the interactions between the nonpolar solutes and completely eliminates the solvent separated minimum (SSM) that is seen in bulk water. The free energy profiles show that the methane molecules are either in contact or at separations corresponding to the diameter and the length of the cylindrical pore. Analytic calculations that estimate the entropy of the solutes, which are solvated at the pore surface, qualitatively explain the shape of the free energy profiles. Adding charges of opposite sign and magnitude 0.4e or e (where e is the electronic charge) to the methane molecules decreases their tendency for surface solvation and restores the SSM. We show that confinement induced ion-pair formation occurs whenever lB/D∼O(1), where lB is the Bjerrum length and D is the pore diameter. The extent of stabilization of the SSM increases with ion charge density as long as lB/D\u003c1. In pores with D≤1.2 nm, in which the water is strongly layered, increasing the charge magnitude from 0.4e to e reduces the stability of the SSM. As a result, ion-pair formation that occurs with negligible probability in the bulk is promoted. In larger diameter pores that can accommodate a complete hydration layer around the solutes, the stability of the SSM is enhanced.","tags":[""],"title":"Water-Mediated Interactions Between Hydrophobic and Ionic Species in Cylindrical Nanopores","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Govardhan Reddy","John E.

We used all atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water, and two force fields, of the WT dimer, a monomer with the lactam bridge (Aβ10−35-lactam[D23−K28]), and the monomer and dimers with harmonically constrained D23−K28 salt bridge (Aβ10−35[D23−K28]) to understand the origin of the enhanced fibril rate formation. The simulations show that the assembly competent fibril-like monomer (N*) structure, which is present among the conformations sampled by the isolated monomer, with strand conformations in the residues spanning the N and C termini and a bend involving residues D23 VGSNKG29, are populated to a much greater extent in Aβ10−35[D23−K28] and Aβ10−35-lactam[D23−K28] than in the WT, which has negligible probability of forming N*. The salt bridge in N* of Aβ10−35[D23−K28], whose topology is similar to that found in the fibril, is hydrated. The reduction in the free energy barrier to fibril formation in Aβ10−35[D23−K28] and in Aβ10−35-lactam[D23−K28], compared to the WT, arises largely due to entropic restriction which enables the bend formation. A decrease in the entropy of the unfolded state and the lesser penalty for conformational rearrangement including the formation of the salt bridge in Aβ peptides with D23−K28 constraint results in a reduction in the kinetic barrier in the Aβ1−40-lactam[D23−K28] congener compared to the WT. The decrease in the barrier, which is related to the free energy cost of forming a bend, is estimated to be in the range (4−7)kBT. Although a number of factors determine the growth of fibrils, the decrease in the free energy barrier, relative to the WT, to N* formation is a major factor in the rate enhancement in the fibril formation of Aβ1−40[D23−K28] congener. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using simulations of Aβ9−40 peptides and various constructs related to the Aβ10−35 systems that were probed using OPLS and CHARMM force fields. We hypothesize that mutations or other constraints that preferentially enhance the population of the N* species would speed up aggregation rates. Conversely, ligands that lock it in the fibril-like N* structure would prevent amyloid formation.","tags":[""],"title":"Influence of Preformed Asp23−Lys28 Salt Bridge on the Conformational Fluctuations of Monomers and Dimers of Aβ Peptides with Implications for Rates of Fibril Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruxandra Dima","Bogdan Tarus","Govardhan Reddy","John E.

Three different problems are studied:  the collapse dynamics of a neutral polymer chain, the conformational properties of a polyelectrolyte chain in a poor solvent, and the adsorption of a polyelectrolyte chain near a charged planar surface. In addition to an explicit solvent model where the solvent atoms are incorporated as a second component, two implicit solvent models are also studied. In the first, called implicit Lennard-Jones (ILJ), the effect of solvent is taken into account via a Lennard-Jones pair potential between the monomers, and in the second, called SASA, the solvent is taken into account via a many-body interaction that depends on the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the monomers. In all cases, there are qualitative differences between the properties predicted by the ILJ and the explicit solvent model. In particular, the ILJ predicts the trapping of a collapsing neutral polymer in metastable states, stable bead−necklace structures of polyelectrolytes in poor solvents, and globule formation without adsorption for polyelectrolytes in poor solvents at a charged surface. For similar systems, on the other hand, the explicit solvent model predicts a smooth collapse, transient bead−necklace structures, and adsorption flat against the surface, respectively. The predictions of the SASA model are in qualitative agreement with the explicit solvent simulations in all cases, although there are quantitative differences.

Two integral equation theories, the reference interaction site model (RISM) and the diagrammatically proper Chandler–Silbey–Ladanyi (CSL) theory, are tested by comparison with simulations of the MSPC model (neither theory converges for the SPC model when the hypernetted chain closure is used). The RISM theory is in reasonable agreement with simulations, and is more accurate than the CSL theory. A density functional theory (DFT) is investigated, which treats the ideal gas functional exactly and uses a truncated expansion for the excess free energy functional. The DFT is in excellent agreement with simulations for the structure of the MSPC water model at all temperatures studied, and for the structure of the SPC water model at high temperatures. At room temperature, the DFT is in good agreement with simulations (of SPC water) for gHH(r) and gOH(r), but misses the location of the second peak in gOO(r). We attribute this deficiency to the importance of three-body correlations that are not properly incorporated in the theory.","tags":[""],"title":"Liquid State Theories for the Structure of Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"be8f5de83c61b81a72058d6157c1134c","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/openpositions/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/openpositions/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our research interests are in the area of theoretical/computational biophysics and biophysical chemistry.\nDepending on the system of interest, we use and develop atomistic, coarse-grained and continuum-based protein-DNA models and appropriate theoretical/computational techniques to gain insight into the relevant physics of the phenomenon.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9a7b5ec1eca80c39f6f6f99e6af57213","permalink":"https://gova-red.github.io/post/generalfocus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/generalfocus/","section":"post","summary":"Our research interests are in the area of theoretical/computational biophysics and biophysical chemistry.\n","tags":null,"title":"Genaral Focus","type":"post"}]
